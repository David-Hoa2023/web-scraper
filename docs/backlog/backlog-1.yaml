scraper_plan:
  architecture:
    - pattern_detection:
        description: |
          Enhance pattern matching to detect repeating elements based on a combination of attributes such as tag name, class, id, data attributes, and aria attributes.
        improvements:
          - add attribute-based matching (class, id, data-*, aria-*)
          - provide visual feedback to highlight groups of matching elements or entire rows
          - allow user to toggle pattern detection detail (e.g., match by tag name, class, id)
    - auto_scroller:
        description: |
          Handle infinite scrolling efficiently and with error handling.
        improvements:
          - implement scroll throttling/debouncing to reduce resource consumption
          - add error handling with retry logic and user notifications
          - simulate "load more" button clicks for sites with such functionality
    - data_extraction:
        description: |
          Improve data extraction heuristics and allow for more flexibility in what data is scraped.
        improvements:
          - allow users to customize data extraction (e.g., specify which fields to scrape)
          - extract data in a hierarchical structure (preserve relationships between data)
          - normalize extracted data to account for varying formats and missing data
    - shadow_dom_handling:
        description: |
          Ensure compatibility with modern sites using web components and shadow DOMs.
        improvements:
          - detect and interact with shadow DOM elements
          - leverage selectors like ::part for web components
          - provide fallback mechanisms for heavily dynamic sites
  user_experience:
    - interface:
        description: |
          Improve user interface for starting, pausing, and stopping scraping processes.
        improvements:
          - add a progress bar for feedback during scraping
          - allow users to specify maximum data limits (e.g., number of items)
          - provide real-time data preview and progress feedback
          - notify user of errors or issues (e.g., "scraping paused due to error")
    - feedback:
        description: |
          Provide better user feedback during scraping to improve usability and transparency.
        improvements:
          - notify user when scraping is paused or completed
          - show a live status of items collected (e.g., "X items collected out of Y expected")
          - allow for quick pausing and restarting of the scraping session
  error_handling:
    - description: |
        Add robust error handling across the scraper to ensure smooth execution and recovery from issues.
    - improvements:
        - retries for failed data loads or extraction
        - handle network issues gracefully (e.g., retry on failure, notify user)
        - ensure scraping can resume from where it left off
  efficiency:
    - description: |
        Improve the scraper’s overall efficiency to minimize resource consumption and improve execution time.
    - improvements:
        - throttle scrolling or introduce delays between scroll actions
        - optimize DOM parsing to avoid unnecessary checks
        - implement an efficient data storage system to avoid memory overflow (e.g., store in batches)
