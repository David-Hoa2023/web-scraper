scraper_plan:
  architecture:
    - hybrid_capture:
        description: |
          Extend the web scraper to simultaneously capture DOM events and screen pixels, enabling rich data logging for both interaction and visual context.
        improvements:
          - integrate video capture API for screen recording
          - sync DOM event logging with video capture for accurate timestamping
          - implement snapshot system to capture page layout at intervals for better synchronization
    - pattern_detection:
        description: |
          Enhance the pattern detection logic to identify repeating HTML structures (e.g., lists, feeds, tables) and trigger content extraction automatically.
        improvements:
          - detect repeating elements based on a combination of tag name, class list, and ID
          - provide visual feedback (highlight detected patterns with distinct overlays)
          - allow user to manually adjust detected patterns for refinement
    - auto_scroller:
        description: |
          Implement an auto-scroller to handle infinite scroll pages efficiently.
        improvements:
          - use `MutationObserver` to track new content loading and trigger scraping when items are added
          - optimize scrolling behavior to minimize resource usage
          - add error handling for cases where scrolling or content extraction fails
    - cursor_smoothing:
        description: |
          Smooth the mouse cursor movements to provide a professional, polished feel for tutorial videos.
        improvements:
          - optimize the Bézier curve calculation for smoother transitions
          - minimize performance overhead during real-time rendering of smooth cursor paths
    - content_generation:
        description: |
          Use an LLM to automatically generate instructional content from recorded interactions.
        improvements:
          - enhance action logging to include contextual information (e.g., user intent, page state)
          - integrate with web scraping app to trigger content generation automatically after data extraction
          - fine-tune output to produce clear, concise, and informative guides
  user_experience:
    - interface:
        description: |
          Improve user interface to provide clear feedback during scraping and content generation.
        improvements:
          - show real-time progress during scraping (e.g., items collected, current page)
          - display tutorial video preview with smooth cursor paths
          - provide notifications for successful content generation or errors
    - feedback:
        description: |
          Allow users to interact with the system to adjust the captured data and generate content.
        improvements:
          - enable manual pattern refinement (user can click to adjust detected patterns)
          - let users modify or review auto-generated guides before final output
          - support exporting content in different formats (e.g., Markdown, PDF)
